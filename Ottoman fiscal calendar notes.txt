For the first two months of 1903 Julian, the Ottoman fiscal year was still 1318. This represents a difference of 585.

Then, on 1 March 1903 Julian, the Ottoman fiscal year clicked over to 1319. This represents a difference of 584.

So it can be said that the difference is 585 for dates before March, and 584 for dates as of March.

Ottoman equivalent months:
0 = January = Kânun-ı Sani
1 = February = Şubat
2 = March = Mart
3 = April = Nisan
4 = May = Mayıs
5 = June = Haziran
6 = July = Temmuz
7 = August = Ağustos
8 = September = Eylül
9 = October = Teşrin-i Evvel
10 = November = Teşrin-i Sani
11 = December = Kânun-ı Evvel

Let's assume, preliminarily, that the conversion details outlined above were valid between 1840-03-01 and 1916-12-31 Julian.
